# Steganography-With-MATLAB

This MATLAB Steganography project is a comprehensive implementation of image data hiding techniques, allowing users to hide secret information within digital images. Steganography is the art of concealing information within another piece of data to maintain privacy and secrecy. This project utilizes MATLAB's powerful image processing capabilities to embed and extract hidden messages from images while preserving the image's visual quality.
